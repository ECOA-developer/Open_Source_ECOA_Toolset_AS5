# Open_Source_ECOA_Toolset_AS5
The Open Source ECOA Toolset (OSETS) allows developers to produce experimental system software which conforms to the European Component Oriented Architecture (ECOA) standard.  

It consists of a plugin for ECLIPSE NEON which produces ECOA XML (allowing the definition of Types; Services; Component Definitions; Initial Assemblies; Component Implementations; Final Assemblies and Logical Systems), as well as a Java-based code generator which produces ECOA Container code in C, for deployment of ECOA software onto a Linux platform.

OSETS supports ECOA Architecture Specification version 5, with the exception of Hierarchical Data Libraries; Quality of Service; and PINFO.

OSETS is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.  In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.  OSETS and its outputs are not claimed to be fit or safe for any purpose.  Any user should satisfy themselves that this software or its outputs are appropriate for its intended purpose.

Information on ECOA (including the specification, tutorials, and guidance material) is available at www.ECOA.technology.
